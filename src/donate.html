  <p class="heading">Important news about impending Thunderbird updates:</p>
    
  <p>Thunderbird 78 is out, but it is not officially pushed out to
    <b> all</b> users as an automatic update 
    (they recently did a 5% roll-out and you are one of the "testers"). 
    One of the reasons is that most
    Add-ons authors are still busy converting their Add-ons to the
    new Add-ons system. This is the same with all my Add-ons - we
    are working towards completing a 78 compatible version which
    will be ready for Thunderbird 78.2 which is going to be pushed
    to all users automatically around September 2020. With a
    complicated Add-on like this we still have several weeks of work
    and testing ahead.<br>
  </p>
  <p>If you have interest or comments in the conversion project
    please visit the quickFilters github:</p>
  <p>https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/14</p>
  <p>Please do not manually upgrade to Thunderbird78 until the issue
    is resolved. Better yet, wait for the automatic update pushed by
    Mozilla.<br>
  </p>
  
  <p>quickFilters is <i><b>fully compatible with Thunderbird 68.12</b></i> - which is
  the latest version of the ending ESR period.</p>

<h3><a name="amount"></a>Do you suggest any amount?</h3>
<p>US$ donations: we suggest 10$ as that seems to be be a what most people like to donate - but of course smaller and greater amounts are always welcome. <br/>
Euro donations: 10 Euros will be considered generous. Some people have given 50$ some 2$, but anything is welcome.

<p>Your tip is important to make QuickFilters even more excellent!</p>

<h2 class="page-header"><a name="freesoftware"></a>Free Software, Yayh!!</h2>
<p>What's the meaning of this <em>free software</em> ??</p>
<h3><em>Free</em> as in <em>Free Speech</em>, not as in <em>Free Beer</em>.</h3>
 <p>I think the most important aspect on free software is that it is a political statement to avoid the pitfalls of
 proprietary, monopoly driven software that coined terms such as "Embrace, Extend and Extinguish" and the innovation crippling
  model of patenting software (for further reading, please see links below).
 At the moment there is a conflict (I almost wrote war) between the old proprietary model of software and the Free Software Concept,
 and its you, the users who will really decide where the future will take us. By downloading the Mozilla products and extensions by
 independant software developers, like quickFilters, you are actively helping the cause.

		<h5 class="infoHeader">The "free" Model</h5>
	  <a href="#freesoftware"><img src="img/Pigs_Free_Model.jpg" class="gallery" alt="the free model." title="the free model..."></a>
	  <br/>
	  <p class="miniquote">As users, we like to use the software the way we want, and we more or less expect it to be free of charge. The question is what
	     do the commercial software vendors make of this? Since the advent of facebook is a shift of users (and their data) from being the customers
	     becoming the merchandise, and the corporations becoming the customer. This is because even the best community sites cannot operate without
	     profit. The web is already overfraught with advertisement and data mining - The alternative is truly <a href="#freesoftware">Free software</a> that is
	     funded by donations.
	     </p>
	</div>

</div>


<br/>there is an excellent description of this concept here:


<div class="quote">
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>Quote: Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer.
<br/>Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
