			<h2 class="page-header">GDPR - quickfolders.org</h2>
			<p>quickfolders.org and the web shop selling its licenses (<a href="https://fastspring.com/">fastspring.com</a>) is <a href="https://fastspring.com/blog/gdpr-beyond-data-privacy-reshaping-digital-economy/">GDPR compliant</a>.</p>
      <h3>Use of the Add-ons</h3>
			<p>While you are using our Add-ons we do not transmit or track any of your information. 
        License validation is done locally on your computer without transmitting or storage of
        your Email or the license key.</p>
      <h3>Ordering licenses</h3>
      <p>
        The web shop at fastspring.com needs certain data in order to process your payment information.
        FastSpring is fully GDPR compliant
      </p>
      <p>
        The license key generation script also requires an email address that needs to be configured in 
        a standard Identity within Thunderbird in order to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon order fulfillment, fastspring will send an order summary email to us with the following information:
      </p>      
      <ul>
        <li>Order Creation date</li>
        <li>Currency</li>
        <li>Order Amount and applied Taxes</li>
        <li>Order location (usually country)</li>
        <li>IP Address</li>
        <li>Referrer String (usually the feature you used or your old license key in case of renewals) </li>
        <li>Product Type, quantity and price</li>
        <li>Your license key including the readable email address (see above)</li>
        <li>Customer Name</li>
        <li>Address (if entered by the Customer)</li>
        <li>Payment type. (e.g. bank draft, Paypal etc.) - as we never process the payments ourselves,
          this is just a general string and does not contain any detail such as card numbers / paypal identity
          etc. If we need this information we have to request it from the web shop.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> We keep this Email for support purposes only. It is never shared with third parties and 
        not stored anywhere externally. It is backed up on an inhouse NAS Server with all my email.
        On demand, we will delete this email.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use this email to for the following purposes only:
        <ul>
          <li>
            To help with fulfillment - sometimes the license key does not get delivered or is deleted as Junk mail.
            in this case we use it to re-issue the license key.
          </li>
          <li>
            To generate a new license - should you need to change your standard identity email address 
            we can generate a new license. Having the original license with the expiry date helps in this 
            case.
          </li>
          <li>
            License expiry reminders. We usually do special promotional offers around the time when we release 
            new versions of the Add-on you use. In this case we contact you once if your license was recently
            expired in order to alert you to the special offer so you can save money while renewing your license.
          </li>
        </ul>
        This is all. According to GDPR you can request the deletion of this email at any time, but we do not advise
        you to this unless you intend to not use the Add-on anymore.
      </p>
