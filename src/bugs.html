	<h3>New Issue Tracker at Github</h3>
	<p>
		To bring issues into the 21st century (and a secure website) - you can now use our 
		<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickfilters/issues">github tracker</a>.
	</p>

<p>
	Up until recently, quickFilters used Bugzilla to maintain information on all bugs.
	With bug trackers it is relatively easy to submit a bug report or upload screen shots,
	you will have to create a free account with bugzilla to do this. As
	with a lot of the Software under the Mozilla development envelope this is also
	a very community driven experience, the more people contribute the better
	and more efficient work on future versions of quickFilters will be.

<h3>Old Tracker at mozdev.org - (deprecated section)</h3>
<p>This database has been shut down and readonly copies have 
  been downloaded and can be referenced from the version history page.</p>
