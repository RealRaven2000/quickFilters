	<h2 class="page-header">quickFilters Pro : Premium Features</h2>

	<p>
		Premium features are power functions which are an incentive for users to regularly support 
		the quickFilters project through a yearly contribution, called quickFilters Pro license. 
		My aim is that instead of very few people trying to carry the project with sometimes large
		donations to try involving more supporters. It is a lot of work to keep the project 
		going and up to date with all the latest code changes which happen every 6 weeks on the Mozilla code base.
		Staying in sync with the three applications (Thunderbird, Postbox and SeaMonkey) and to support multiple 
		platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and languages and writing support emails and fixing bugs is actually a lot of work. 
		I would rather actually spend more time on this as opposed to maybe 6 to 12 hours / week, but for this it 
		needs to be financially viable.
	</p>
	
	<a name="featureList"></a>
	<h3>Premium Features Included</h3>
	<p>Here is a list of Premium features that are unrestricted to licensed users of quickFilters Pro.</p> 
	<p>For non-licensed users, the premium features may be restricted and when used display a notification bar
		in order to promote buying a license. I feel this is the best way as it gives you a chance to try them out and 
		get an idea on what other great future functionality will be funded by supporters:
	<p>
	<table class="featureList">
		<tr>
			<th>Premium Feature</th>
			<th>What does it do?</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Sort Filters</td>
			<td>
				<img src="img/premium-sort.png" alt="sort filters" class="inlineImage"/>
				<span>
					use this to sort all selected filters by alphabet. Be careful as the order
					the filters are displayed in is also the execution order. This means that 
					you may have to rename some more specialised filters so they appear before
					more general ones (e.g. have the filter move to <i>clients\Acme</i> filter listed 
					<i>before</i> the move to <i>clients</i> filter.)<br>
					Otherwise you may find your emails in unexpected locations: An email that has already
					been moved away from the Inbox will not be treated by the following filters.
				</span>
				<p class="smaller">
					There is also an option on the "New Filter Properties" tab that enables to <i>insert 
					new filters in alphabetical order</i>. This will work best if the existing list of
					filters is already sorted alphabetically. This is becayse it will not "look ahead" beyond 
					alphabetically lower entries and attempt to insert the new filter after them.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Sort Search Terms</td>
			<td>
				<img src="img//sort-search-terms.png" alt="sort search terms" class="inlineImage"/>
				<span>
					Use this to sort all search terms by type and text content. This is helpful with filters that 
          have many search terms. It is only available from quickFilters version 5.2 onwards, so it requires 
          at least Thunderbird 78.0 to be used.
          Note that Thunderbird doesn't react well to filters with more than 100 terms 
          (the editor may time out or hang and the filter may stop working), in this case
          consider breaking up the filter into multiple filters with less items.
          For a detailed desription on this function, see 
          <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/11">[issue 11]</a>
				</span>
			</td>
		</tr>    
		<tr>
			<td>Custom Templates</td>
			<td>
				Custom Templates can be created from the <i>Advanced</i> tab of the
				quickFilters preferences dialog. These are new filter templates that can be used
				during the filter assistant process as choices for creating new filters. They will
				preselect &amp; prefill some filter conditions based on a big number of mail
				attributes.<br>
        <img src="img/Custom-Template-Option.png"  class="screenshot"/><br>
        <img src="img/Custom-Template-Edit.png"  class="screenshot"/><br>
        
				<p class="smaller">
				  Custom Templates are stored like standard filters but are located in the "Local Folders" account
					and have the string "quickFilterCustomTemplate" in the start of their name.
					The rest of the name is what is shown in the assistant dialog.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Backup / Restore</td>
			<td>
			  <img src="img/backup-restore.png" alt="backup / restore filters" class="screenshot">
				<br>
				[Available from <a href="version.html#3.5">version 3.5</a>] - you can now save your filters 
				for each mailbox to a file and  load them later or transfer to a different Thunderbird profile. 
				For technical reasons, currently old filters will not be overwritten - therefore unwanted filters should be 
				removed manually after restoring to avoid duplication.
				<p class="smaller">
				  When transferring to a different profile, Custom filter actions (e.g. create with FilteQuilla) will only work 
					if they are set up exactly the same on both 
					profiles.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>		
		<tr>
			<td>Search Folders for Filters</td>
			<td>
				<img src="img/premium-searchFilters.png" alt="sort" class="inlineImage"/>
				This command makes it possible to find all filters that move emails to a specific
				folder. this is especially helpful when mail is moved / copied across different
				mail accounts or into Local Folders. Right-click a mail folder from the 
				folder tree on the left hand side of Thunderbird's 3 pane window and select
				<i>Find Filters...</i>.
				<p class="smaller">
					<a href="https://quickfolders.org/" target="_blank">QuickFolders</a> users can also add this button to the
					<a href="https://quickfolders.org/index#CurrentFolderToolbar" target="_blank"><i>Current Folder toolbar</i></a>.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Insert Copied filters to multiple accounts</td>
			<td>
        This allows you to select a number of filters and
        copy them to different other accounts, repeatedly.
        This option can be enabled on the Advanced tab in quickFilters settings.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Find Duplicates</td>
			<td>
				<img src="img/premium-duplicates.png" alt="duplicates" class="inlineImage"/>
				This is a button on the quickFilters toolbar in the Filters List which searches 
				for various types of duplicates, such as filters that do the same thing 
				(like move mails to the same folder) or have duplicate conditions. It is a great
				utility for tidying up unclear filters or even find filters that do unexpected stuff.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Local Inbox</td>
			<td>
			Option to run filters on Local Folders Inbox automatically.
			With this new option, any emails that are moved to the Local Folders Inbox will be automatically
			processed again using the filters defined there. With Thunderbird out of the box this behavior
			cannot be achieved as there is no "Get new Mail" event on Local Folders. 
			You can activate it on the <i>Pro</i> tab of quickFilters options.

	<h3>Other Benefits of having a Yearly License</h3>
	<p>
		You know that you support the project and that the development and support will be continue.
		There is a huge amount of work involved not just programming and keeping quickFilters up to date 
		but also supporting users, coming up with better ways of doing things, fixing bugs, and keeping 
		quickFilters usable across various platforms and host programs (at the moment I support Thunderbird, 
		SeaMonkey and Postbox). I am constantly helping people with using quickFilters and their mail program 
		and how to get the most out of email on the desktop.
	</p>
	<p>
		All notification messages that indicate premium features are omitted.
	</p>
	<p>
		The donation screen (which is normally shown after every Update) is hidden.
	</p>
	<h3>Alternative Monetisation Models</h3>
	<p>
		There are quite a few software developers (and also some users) who believe
		that software should generally financed by advertisement or even by selling 
		information about their users. 
		I am firmly opposed to this way of making money as it impacts 
		both productivity and privacy rights; also in the world of Email I would 
		find this way of generating value deeply problematic - even if it was 
		strictly opt-in. There is a lot of personal information in our daily mail 
		and a lot of knowledge that is being stored and retrieved with this powerful 
		tool. 
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the reasons for a personal Email Client on the desktop 
		is the fact that we can store our data on our personal hardware and use it 
		any way we like. On the other hand, if we use a web mail client (like gmail) 
		we can never be sure whether the information is used otherwise and whether 
		we get targeted with distracting information (be it by injecting advertisements or via 
		targeted advertisement emails) - it is one of the goals of any mail desktop client 
		to eliminiate these distractions as much as possible, and focus on one thing only:
		managing communication.
	</p>
	<p>
		quickFilters is an especially powerful set of tools to harness this 
		information and it will evolve and keep saving time and make your experience 
		of mail more meaningful and intuitive.
	</p>
