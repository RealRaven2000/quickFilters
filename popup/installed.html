      <h1>Successfully installed {addon} </h1>
        <p>Thank you for installing {addon}. You are now running {addon} <b>{version}</b> on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>
        
        <p>To help {addon} stay functional and alive:</p>
        <ul class="actions">
          <li>Purchase a license</li>
          <li>Help out with a one time donation.</li>

        <h2>Buy a License!</h2>
          
        <p>My Add-ons are currently undergoing fundamental changes in order to
          remain compatible with the Mozilla platform. Changes there have been
          increasingly more complex to the point that the annual conversion 
          effort to the new ESR period takes a considerable amount of time
          and resources.</p>
          
        <p>In the case of {addon}, alterations to the new legacy-less
          model already took multiple weeks and are still ongoing, while 
          it is likely that we will be losing some functionality. With a 
          complex Add-on like this its inevitable.</p>
          
        <p class="actionlinks">
            <a id="register">I want to buy a license</a>
        </p>      
          
        <h2>Help with a Donation!</h2>
        
        <p>Software  development costs time and money - unlike many platform apps,
          Add-ons are not written
          by large corporations, nor are they sponsored in any way by Mozilla.
          Mozilla only provide us with a platform to bring our software to you,
          the end users - if we need to charge or ask for help we cannot do
          this from addons.thunderbird.net - it is not an "app store" with built in
          paywalls or license management like iTunes or google play.</p>
          
        <p>In order to remain useful, Add-on authors have to now raise the funds
          necessary to repair and rewrite so that our users can keep benefiting
          from the functionality we bring to the table. </p>
