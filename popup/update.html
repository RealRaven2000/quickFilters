    <h1>{addon} Updated</h1>
    <p>Thank you for updating {addon}. You are now running <b class="versionnumber">version {version}</b> on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>
    
    <p>My Add-ons require fundamental changes in order to
      remain compatible with the Mozilla platform. My team at github.com
      (realraven2000, opto and paenglab) is working to make {addon} fully 
      functional again.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      We have already spent over 200 hours on the conversion project - and there is more work in
      fixing regressions and problems caused by changes in Thunderbird.
    </p>
    
    <p>To help {addon} stay functional and alive:</p>
    <ul class="actions">
      <li>Purchase a license</li>
      <li>Help out with a one time donation.</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h2>Buy a License!</h2>
    
    <p>In the case of {addon}, alterations to the new legacy-less
      model already took multiple weeks and are still ongoing, while 
      it is likely that we will be losing some functionality. With a 
      complex Add-on like this its inevitable.</p>
      
	    <p class="actionlinks">
	      <a id="register">I want to buy a license</a>
	    </p>  
      
    <h2>Help with a Donation!</h2>
    
    <p>Software  development costs time and money - unlike many platform apps,
      Add-ons are not written
      by large corporations, nor are they sponsored in any way by Mozilla.
      Mozilla only provide us with a platform to bring our software to you,
      the end users - if we need to charge or ask for help we cannot do
      this from addons.thunderbird.net - it is not an "app store" with built in
      paywalls or license management like iTunes or google play.</p>
      
    <p>In order to remain useful, Add-on authors have to now raise the funds
      necessary to repair and rewrite so that our users can keep benefiting
      from the functionality we bring to the table. </p>
      
    <p class="actionlinks">
      <a id="donate">I want to contribute with a one time donation</a>
