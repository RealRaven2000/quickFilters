# Objective

The NotifyTools provide a bidirectional messaging system between Experiments scripts and the WebExtension's background page (even with [e10s](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb91/changes#thunderbird-is-now-multi-process-e-10-s) being enabled in Thunderbird Beta 86).

They allow to work on add-on uprades in smaller steps, as single calls (like `window.openDialog()`)
in the middle of legacy code can be replaced by WebExtension calls, by stepping out of the Experiment
and back in when the task has been finished.

# Usage

Add the [NotifyTools API](https://github.com/thundernest/addon-developer-support/tree/master/auxiliary-apis/NotifyTools) to your add-on. Your `manifest.json` needs an entry like this:

```
  "experiment_apis": {
    "NotifyTools": {
      "schema": "api/NotifyTools/schema.json",
      "parent": {
        "scopes": ["addon_parent"],
        "paths": [["NotifyTools"]],
        "script": "api/NotifyTools/implementation.js",
        "events": ["startup"]
      }
    }
  },
```

Additionally to the [NotifyTools API](https://github.com/thundernest/addon-developer-support/tree/master/auxiliary-apis/NotifyTools) the [notifyTools.js](https://github.com/thundernest/addon-developer-support/tree/master/scripts/notifyTools) script is needed as the counterpart in Experiment scripts.

**Note:** You need to adjust the `notifyTools.js` script and add your add-on ID at the top.

## Receiving notifications from Experiment scripts

Add a listener for the `onNotifyBackground` event in your WebExtension's background page:

```
messenger.NotifyTools.onNotifyBackground.addListener(async (info) => {
  switch (info.command) {
    case "doSomething":
      //do something
      let rv = await doSomething();
      return rv;
      break;
  }
});
```

The `onNotifyBackground` event will receive and respond to notifications send from your Experiment scripts:

```
notifyTools.notifyBackground({command: "doSomething"}).then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

Include the [notifyTools.js](https://github.com/thundernest/addon-developer-support/tree/master/scripts/notifyTools) script in your Experiment script to be able to use `notifyTools.notifyBackground()`.

**Note**: If multiple `onNotifyBackground` listeners are registered in the WebExtension's background page and more than one is returning data, the value
from the first one is returned to the Experiment. This may lead to inconsistent behavior, so make sure that for each
request only one listener is returning data.


## Sending notifications to Experiments scripts

Use the `notifyExperiment()` method to send a notification from the WebExtension's background page to Experiment scripts:

```
messenger.NotifyTools.notifyExperiment({command: "doSomething"}).then((data) => {
  console.log(data)
});
```

The receiving Experiment script needs to include the [notifyTools.js](https://github.com/thundernest/addon-developer-support/tree/master/scripts/notifyTools) script  and must setup a listener using the following methods:

### registerListener(callback);

Registers a callback function, which is called when a notification from the WebExtension's background page has been received. The `registerListener()` function returns an `id` which can be used to remove the listener again.

Example:

```
function doSomething(data) {
  console.log(data);
  return true;
}
let id = notifyTools.registerListener(doSomething);
```

### removeListener(id)

Removes the listener with the given `id`.

Example:

```
notifyTools.removeListener(id);
```

### enable()

The [notifyTools.js](https://github.com/thundernest/addon-developer-support/tree/master/scripts/notifyTools) script attaches its `enable()` method to the `load` event of the current window. If the script is loaded into a window-less environment, `enable()` needs to be called manually.

### disable()

The [notifyTools.js](https://github.com/thundernest/addon-developer-support/tree/master/scripts/notifyTools) script attaches its `disable()` method to the `unload` event of the current window. If the script is loaded into a window-less environment, `disable()` needs to be called manually.
