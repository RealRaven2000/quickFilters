<ul>
<li>quickFilters is now compatible with Thunderbird 91, which commences the next ESR period (2021-2022).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/67">[issue 67]</a> Added colored icons and theme support in message filter list toolbar. </li>
<li>Splash screen: instead of displaying this as soon as Thunderbird installs a new version of Thunderbird, this is now available by clicking the message on the assistant button which shows the fact that quickFilters was updated.</li>
<li>Options are now available through Add-ons Manager / quickFilters "Wrench Icon".</li>
<li>Restricted special search methods in the filter list to licensed users only.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The link on the registration screen in 5.3 accidentally directed to buy a QuickFolders license. This is now fixed in version 5.3.1.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/66">[issue 66]</a> Fixed: On some machines, quickFilters is not loading at startup (due to accounts not loading)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/68">[issue 68]</a> Fixed: Moving mails with context menu moves wrong mails (it switched to mail below the selection and moved that instead). </li>
<li>When an invalid license was entered in version 5.3 no feedback or reason for it not working was given.</li>
