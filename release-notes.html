quickFilters Change Log - Version 4.5


I am currently working on compatibility with Thunderbird beta 88.0 for preparing next years ESR period (2021/2022).

I will also have to eventually rewrite all mail Add-ons as web extensions, which is currently not yet possible as all necessary APIs to replace the deprecated tech has not been implemented. As in between step I have released quickFilters 5.1 as a "mail experiment" for Thunderbird 78+. If you are interested in using a version of quickFilters that works with Thunderbird 78, <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/instant/quickfilters?referrer=atn-version-notes">buy a license</a> to support the project.
