quickFilters Change Log - Version 6.0

<b>Changes</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Thunderbird 115 switched to the Unified toolbar which generally takes up less space
    than the separate mail toolbar of previous versions. quickFilters uses a new
    action button which includes all its commands in a single dropdown menu:
    <p>
      <img src="https://quickfilters.quickfolders.org/img/quickfilters-actionbutton.png" alt="quickFilters actions button" class="screenshot">
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, Add-on buttons always appear <i>on the right</i> of the toolbar,
      but you can move them to a better position by <i>right-clicking</i> the toolbar 
      and selecting "customize...":<br><br>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    News / license warnings are integrated into the new Action button. Highlight colors 
    and placement of important commands on the top spot will guide the user to click 
    the currently most important action:
    <p>
      When a new version is installed, read the "whats new" splash screen and reset the button:<br>
      <img src="https://quickfilters.quickfolders.org/img/qi-check-news.png" alt="quickFilters news menu" class="screenshot">
    </p>
    <p>
      When the license is close to expiry, to check the license status:<br>
      <img src="https://quickfilters.quickfolders.org/img/qi-check-license-renew.png" alt="quickFilters check license menu" class="screenshot">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    New option to disable notification when a filter is run manually (quickFilters Pro users only).
  </li>
  <li>
    Added traditional Chinese translations for User Interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    For more detail on what functions had to be fixed / rewritten, please read on
    the <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/181">Github Issue</a> 
    covering conversion to Thunderbird 115.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Open Issues / Regressions for Thunderbird 115</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    The context menu in the thread list is missing the "Create Filter from message"
    menu item - this will be delivered in a future version. 
    For now, you can use the command from the action button tools menu:
    <p>
      <img src="https://quickfilters.quickfolders.org/img/qi-button-newfilterfrommsg.png" alt="create filter from message" class="screenshot">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Eventually, all settings will be displayed in a Thunderbird tab, like
    the settings of most mail extensions. For this, it is still required to 
    rewrite the dialog in HTML format.
  </li>

</ul>


<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    This version includes all bugfixes up to version 5.9.3. Going forward, the code 
    for Thunderbird 115 and for previous versions is in separate branches in order
    to simplify maintenance and the code base getting polluted by too manually
    incompatible choices.

</ul>
