<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li> Maintenance fix in v6.5.3: The merge filters option had stopped working in 6.5. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/262">[issue 262]</a>  </li>
  <li> Fixed: Cut & Paste filters didn't work in Thunderbird 128   <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/249">[issue 249]</a>  </li>
  <li> Thunderbird 128 - Notifications are now async! This may lead to the filter assistant not starting up successfully a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/258">[issue 258]</a>
  </li>
  <li> Fixed: After using any function, from its dowdown menu, quickFilters toolbar button 
    looked like it is always active <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/223">[issue 223]</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Miscellaneus</b>
<ul>
<li>  Removed vendor prefix from -moz-appearance </li>
<li>  msgsMoveCopyCompleted: remove "no destmsg!"  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/254">[issue 254]</a></li>
</ul>

<b>Known Issues</b>
<ul>
  <li> Currently the verification of quickFilters licenses fails when the license is bound to an exchange account when it is accessed using Owl. This is due to a bug in  the <a href="https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/accounts.html#accounts-api">extensions.accounts</a> Webextensions API - which doesn't include them when using <tt>accounts.list()</tt> - 
    which the Thunderbird team is working on and is planned to land in one of the next versions of ESR128.  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/260">[issue 260]</a>  </li>
</ul>  


All development and free support work for quickFilters is financed via the 
<a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/quickfilters?referrer=ATN">quickFilters 
Pro license</a> which also adds 
some <a href="https://quickfilters.quickfolders.org/premium.html#featureList">additional features.</a>
