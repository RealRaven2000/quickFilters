quickFilters Change Log - Version 4.2

<ul>
<li> The buttons on the QuickFolders "current folder toolbar" are not displayed anymore in Thunderbird 68.</li>
<li> Custom filters: removing / avoiding own email addresses from new filter conditions is not working 
      in Custom Filters. This is now remedied. If you need to add your own email address to the filter conditions
      its probably a safe bet you would want to do it manually.</li>
<li> To celebrate the arrival of Thunderbird 68 - Make sure to catch the September sale  - get a license for 33% off</li>
</ul>
