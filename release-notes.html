quickFilters Change Log - Version 5.4

<b>Changes in 5.4</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/89">[issue 89]</a> Create filter by subject - option to insert the full subject if [string] in line. 

In the default behavior, when generating a filter by subject, quyickFilters will look for terms in square or curly braces, such as [honey] or {Fans} and extracts only these. This format is often used by mailing lists or to group mails in a topic. If you switch on this new option, the full subject line will always be inserted into the search condition.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/77">[issue 77]</a> When copying an email during assistant, the action "Copy to Folder" should be set + populated. At the moment this defaults back to "move to folder" and might also suggest merging with other filters of the wrong action.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/92">[issue 92]</a> Added a method to view license extension sooner than 1 month before expiry of Pro license. If you need to extend your license by another year before it expires, you can click the valid date in Settings / quickFilters Pro tab to open the licensing screen to extend it.</li>
</ul>
