quickFilters Change Log - Version 5.6

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li> Fixed <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/123">[issue 123]</a> Clicking Sort leads to empty search terms (Thunderbird 102 regression) </li>
<li> Fixed toolbar Icon colors for Thunderbird 102</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/125">[issue 125]</a> Support license validation with Exchange accounts (from Tb 102) </li>
<li> Improved default filter name for starred messages - now includes the folder name as well.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/129">[issue 129]</a> Improved integration of buttons on QuickFolders' current folder bar.

The optional quickFilters toolbar button which can be added to the QuickFolders Navigation bar (Current folder toolbar) via Advanced settings can be missing if Add-ons are loaded in the wrong order or whenever QF is disabled / updated.

This fix improves communication between both Add-ons to ensure the buttons are never missing (requires QuickFolders 5.14 or higher - to get a preview version of that, <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/316">check here</a>).
</li>
<li> Support triggering the assistant when adding a Star to a message in the Inbox through the context menu,, without triggering the warning about being more useful after moving mail to another folder.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Removed all inline command handlers - added them via script instead. [issue 122]</li>  
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/102">[issue 102]</a> WIP: Support mixed "any" / "all" filters with mail clients that do (<a href="https://www.betterbird.eu/">Betterbird</a> 91.8). If the Mail Program supports nested conditions, parentheses (beginsGrouping and endsGrouping) are now processed as numeric and not as boolean (as of Betterbird). </li>
</ul>
