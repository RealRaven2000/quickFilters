quickFilters Change Log - Version 5.7

<b>Maintenance Fixes - 5.7.1</b>
<ul>
<li> From v5.7 - once the assistant is active, <i>deleting emails</i> triggered it and prompted to create new filters. This behavior was unintended. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/142#">[issue 142]</a>
</li>
<li> The quickFilters filter assistant could be triggered by filters that execute moving / copying mail! I am currently working on a permanent fix for this issue. There are already 
prereleases available here:

<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/143">[issue 143]</a>

From 5.7.1 on it will be checking if there are already filters active that may have successfully moved the mail, in which case the assistant is not invoked.</li>
</ul>


<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li> Fixed <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/133">[issue 133]</a> Reply-To filter is case sensitive - should be case insensitive </li>
<li> Avoid accidentally running filters through Shortcut, add confirmation dialog. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/132">[issue 132]</a></li>
<li> Fixed: help text of tooltip (e.g. actions in filter editor) not readable in dark themes.</li>
<li> You can now create filters that move mail across to another inbox. Previously such mail movements did not trigger the assistant.</li> 
<li> Removed Thunderbird patch code, if you use QuickFolders you must update it to version 5.15.1 to avoid duplicate assistant prompts. </li>
<li> Removed sync-stream-listener which will go away in future versions of Thunderbird. </li>
<li> Improved naming of new filters if standard tags (such as Important, Work) are added. </li>
</ul>
