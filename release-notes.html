quickFilters Change Log - Version 4.4


I am currently paying somebody to migrate all my Add-on support sites away from the free host on mozdev.org, which is closing operation end of June. To keep having support sites and ongoing development, please <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/instant/quickfilters?referrer=atn-version-notes">buy a license</a> (the complete migration cost me $650, so there are some expense I hope to recover from the community of users).

I will also have to rewrite all mail Add-ons as web extensions, which is currently not yet possible as all necessary APIs to replace the deprecated tech has not been implemented. As in between step I plan to release QuickFolders as a "web experiment" for Thunderbird 78+ but this will take a few weeks of work. If you are interested in using a version of quickFilters that works with Thunderbird 78, <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/instant/quickfilters?referrer=atn-version-notes">buy a license</a> to support the project.
