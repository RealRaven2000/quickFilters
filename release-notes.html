<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/100">[issue 100]</a> Improve location of toolbar buttons when installing quickFilters

When installing quickFilters for the first time, the new buttons appear to the right of the application menu. A better location would be to the left of the search box, aligned to the last visible button (in this example "Quick Filter")
</li>
<li> Increasing maximum TB version for next ESR - Thunderbird 102.* is supported from now on.</li>
<li> Added new domain part extractors for custom templates: Root domain, Subdomain, Domain name extension. These will usually work reliably depending on how exotic your domain extensions are. However it doesn't check against the database of extensions that look like domains, such as "pharma.pro", here the algorithm will falsely assume that the URL "tools.pharma.pro" consists of:

subdomain = tools, root domain = pharma, extension = pro 

- even though in reality it is:
  
root domain = tools, extension = pharma.pro
  
I am not doing an online sanity check here, so double check when you use these functions to create new filter templates.</li>
<li> Added a help panel in custom template editor that explains the placeholder action "set priority to normal". When the assistant creates a new filter it will always add the appropriate action (such as move to current folder or tag with the current tag) based on what the user did. Since the filter editor needs at least one action the custom template editor just uses a "neutral" action (set priority to normal) as a placeholder. This should be left alone - do not try to set a "move to folder action" unless you want to do it and expect this action to be hardcoded in all filters you want to generate with this template.</li>
<li> Added more transparency for features that require a Pro license. You can use these features a limited number of times the remaining of which will now be displayed in the license notification at the bottom of the screen. All usage counts will be reset when this new version is installed.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bugs Fixed</b>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/105">[issue 105]</a>  Fixed: Backup of Custom Templates (Local Folders) does not store placeholders correctly. </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/104">[issue 104]</a> Fixed: Filter Rules sorting - fails if no quickFilters Pro license is present.</li>
<li> Fixed "copy" icon in filter list removed in TB102. </li>
<li> Fixed sliding notification panels for Thunderbird 99 and higher. </li>
<li> Fixed sliding notification icon for Thunderbird 91. </li>
<li> Fixed icon on OS notification (Run filters on folder / selected mails...) </li>
<li> Fixed a problem with alias email addresses in license.</li>
<li> Tested with <a href="https://www.betterbird.eu/">Betterbird</a> so that new can be generated. Future Work: intelligent merging into subgroups depending on template. E.g.  subject AND (from OR from OR from).</li>
</ul>
