<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li> 
    Fixed: In Local Folders, the assistant was not opening when using the context menu to 
    create filters from a message 
    <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/235">[issue 235]</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed some issues with displaying quickFilters buttons in the QuickFolders
      Navigation bar (Current Folder bar). Because Thunderbird 115 reimplented 
      the 3-pane window, this can create multiple instances of this toolbar across 
      multiple tabs in a child document of the 3pane, which turned out to be harder 
      to reimplement for this ESR.
