quickFilters Change Log - Version 6.1

<b>New functions</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Implemented command "Create Filter from message" in the context menu in the messages list. 
    Just right-click any message after it was moved to a folder (or tagged if you want to create 
    tags through filters)
  </li>
  <li>
    For more detail on what functions had to be fixed / rewritten for Thunderbird 115, please read on
    the <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/issues/181">Github Issue</a> 
    covering conversion to Thunderbird 115.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    This version includes all bugfixes up to version 5.9.3. Going forward, the code 
    for Thunderbird 115 and for previous versions is in separate branches in order
    to simplify maintenance and the code base getting polluted by too manually
    incompatible choices.
  </li>
</ul>  


<b>Open Issues / Regressions for Thunderbird 115</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    The context menu in the thread list is missing the "Create Filter from message"
    menu item - this will be delivered in a future version. 
    For now, you can use the command from the action button tools menu:
    <p>
      <img src="https://quickfilters.quickfolders.org/img/qi-button-newfilterfrommsg.png" alt="create filter from message" class="screenshot">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Eventually, all settings will be displayed in a Thunderbird tab, like
    the settings of most mail extensions. For this, it is still required to 
    rewrite the dialog in HTML format.
  </li>
  <li>
    Should you encounter any regressions / unusual behavior after updating to Thunderbird 115

</ul>
