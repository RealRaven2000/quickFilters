quickFilters Change Log - Version 3.12.1

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26657" target="_blank">[Bug 26657]</a>  ESR 2019 Readyness - compatibility with Thunderbird 68

Made quickFilters compatible with Thunderbird 68 - part of the ongoing effort to future proof quickFilters for 2020.  For now, this also means making the minimum requirement using Thunderbird version 60. 

I may back-port new features to older versions on demand - these will be handled on a <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters/tree/Tb-52">separate Github branch</a>. Note that the Add-on will be necessarily released as 2 different version numbers for 60 and 68 because of the differences in architecture.,

<ul> 
<li> Replaced prefwindows with dialogs.</li>
<li> Use newer preferences script.</li>
<li> Replace groupbox elements with html fieldsets.</li>
<li> Use new promise-based AddonManager object.</li>
</ul> 
</li>
<li> The premium feature notification was not displaying the "close" button, this is now fixed.</li>
</ul>
