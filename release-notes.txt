      Thunderbird 57 beta hangs on start with quickFilters enabled.
      <br>
      <p>A number of changes to the JavaScript engine necessitate various changes to 
      the code. Most important, the changes are incompatible with the Postbox
      script engine (and are very hard to code around as an important construct, 
      the for loop, which is used in a lot of places will lead to the Add-on
      breaking down in Postbox) - therefore this version will _not_ support
      Postbox.</p>
