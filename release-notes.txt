<ul>
<li>From now on - quickFilters shows no more donation tab on update - update news are handled via the change log.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLApv7QYQO9nSUTaBbX8ZTz2XcIt61l73V">link to quickFilters videos</a> my YouTube channel on the support tab.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26630" target="_blank">[Bug 26630]</a> - optimised the quickFilters Assistant  by restricting the maximum height - otherwise the merge list can grow very tall. Also the dialog used to grow too wide when certain templates were selected.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26192" target="_blank">[Bug 26192]</a> - Improved "mailing list" template  to use the <i>"List-id"</i> header, where available. This header is often used by mailing lists.  If the <i>List-id</i> header doesn't exist, the filter uses the sender's address, as in previous versions of quickFilters.</li>
<li>Backup / Restore Filters will now remember the last folder that was picked for loading / saving.</li>
<li>If filters with custom actions cannot be backed up successfully this will be now be displayed in detail.</li>
<li>Added easier Renewal logic that reads the old license date and adds a whole year even when extending license early. If your license expires within 30 days, the quickFilters Pro tab will display an "extend license" button.
