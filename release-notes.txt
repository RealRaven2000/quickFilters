Creating Filter on IMAP fails after 7 attempts. This can happen during when  moving mails during the quickFilters assistant being active but in some cases (3.0.1) even when it is off. It is caused by the Message Database being locked during or after the move; this fix tries to extract the message header information (needed for filter creation) before the move operation is initiated.
