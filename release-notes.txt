<li><a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26625" target="_blank">[Bug 26625]</a>  New filters do not automatically run when getting mail. This problem was introduced in  version 2.8 by not adding an important flag to the filter type, based on the new setting  <i>"Run Manually"</i> (and later the additional settings in the <i>"Apply Filter when"</i> box)

The flags <tt>nsMsgFilterType.InboxRule</tt> or <tt>nsMsgFilterType.NewsRule</tt> have to be added to existing filters that had the "manual" box unchecked.

You can use the new "Debug" button to track down and fix these filters.</li>
<li> Filters are now merged on import.  When a filter is imported it will overwrite a filter of the same name,
		  rather than creating a duplicate. </li>
<li> Fixed some layout problems (truncation) in filter assistant.</li>
