        Premium Feature: Support Creation of Custom Templates
        A custom template is like a blueprint for generating new filters, and will be shown along with the other choices in the quickFilters assistant. 
				
        To create a custom template:
      <ol>
        <li>Go to quickFilters options (right-click the filter assistant button)</li>
        <li>Go to the Advanced Tab and after enabling [x] Custom Templates, click [Create New...]
        <li>Enter the name of the custom template
        <li>Edit the filter by selecting from the Custom Variables drop-down. This will create a new condition with a placeholder variable which will be replaced with the "real thing" when you create a new filter.
        <li>Make sure you leave the label "quickFilterCustomTemplate: " at the start of the Template Name;  this will ensure that it will be offered as choice the next time you create a filter.
      </ol>
      
      Some Detail:
      
      In Postbox / SeaMonkey there is no way to filter the list of filters (no search box), so when you click "Edit" beside Custom Templates, you may see _all_ filters in Local Folders. Just select the ones starting with "quickFilterCustomTemplate:" for editing. 
      
      There is a default action of "Set Priority to Normal" as it is not possible to save a filter <i>without any</i> actions. Since incoming mail usually has normal priority I chose this as the lesser evil. This action will be removed and the standard action added instead: move to folder / or flag / tag  as the mail that was moved / tagged when assistant was invoked.
      
      A typical example for a custom filter would be a filter template that moves all emails from a given domain (e.g. emails ending with @youtube.com). This can easily be created with the custom filter template and then invoked whenever a new filter has to be created. 
         
      To create this the only thing you need to do is select Custom Variables &gt; From &gt; Domain of Email, and save the Custom Template. On filter creation, you will select the Template of the name you created and it would automatically create a condition "where From ends with @<i>domainname</i>", automatically filling <i>domainname</i> from the current email. If you want to hardcode other actions into the Custom Template u can do this as well, just remember to remove the "Set priority to Normal" action (unless you want to do this).
